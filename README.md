Serf RPC Client for .NET
========================

C# RPC Client for [HashiCorp Serf](https://www.serfdom.io).

This repo provides the client package for HashiCorp's Serf, based on official [GO implementation](https://github.com/hashicorp/serf/tree/master/client) on the documentation that can be found [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/serf/client). This is used to interact with a Serf agent using the msgpack RPC system it supports.
